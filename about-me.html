                    Hello there! My name is Marcel van Duijn, and I am a 23-year-old game developer and hobby artist. I am extremely passionate about creating games and spend a lot of my time immersed in the world of game development. I am currently working on multiple projects, with one of them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2257800/Cannon_Climbing/" target="_blank">Cannon Climbing.</a>, being close to completion.
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2257800/Cannon_Climbing/" target="_blank">Cannon Climbing.</a> is a challenging and addictive precision platformer that puts you in control of a cannon on a daring quest to climb to the top of a colossal test chamber. Using your shooting abilities, you must carefully propel yourself upwards, navigating through various obstacles and challenges. One wrong move, and you'll find yourself plummeting all the way back down to the bottom. It's been an exciting journey bringing this game to life in Unity3D, and I can't wait to share it with others.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to game development, I also enjoy creating simulations, renders, and other digital art in my free time. I find immense joy in the process of creating things online that others can use and enjoy. With a passion for both art and technology, I strive to continue pushing the boundaries of my creativity and skills in the world of game development and digital art.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and projects!</p>
